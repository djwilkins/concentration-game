# Memory Game ("Concentration")
#### BACKGROUND
* This is my version of "the Memory Game" project from Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
* While the basic look and feel of the app components were provided to students, I took the initial static "deck of cards" webpage and turned it into the fully functioning game found here using vanilla JavaScript.
#### INSTALLATION
To run the application locally, simply do the following:
1. Download the project files into a folder anywhere on your machine.
2. Open the memory.html file in that folder in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
3. Play the game!
#### DEMO
For a quicker way to try it out, you can run it from my website here:
